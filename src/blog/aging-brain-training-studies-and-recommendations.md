> According to the National Library of Medicine, one of the latest medical science research studies recommends the following brain training exercises:

## 5 Brain-Boosting Physical Exercises

1. **Aerobic exercise**: Regular aerobic exercise boosts blood flow to the brain and increases the size of the hippocampus, the part of your brain involved in verbal memory and learning.
2. **Weight training**
3. **Yoga**
4. **Tai chi**
5. **Dancing**

## Word Exercises

- Scrabble
- Wordle
- Crossword Puzzles
- Synonym/Antonym Games
- Sudoku
- Trivial Pursuit (or any word or memory game)

According to the data in this study, those who participated in the recommended brain games, such as those suggested above, have shown positive improvement in the referenced cognitive functions compared with baseline results in healthy subjects. This means the group that did the exercises showed improvements over and above the results of those who did not do the exercises.

## What Can Happen During the Aging Process

The study notes that during normal aging, alterations occur in the hippocampus and the cerebellum. These changes may be linked to Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, with impairment in cognitive processes such as short- and long-term memory, speed, and executive functions. Cognitive functions—including attention, memory, and analytical ability—may functionally decrease with age. Aphasia is a difficulty in finding words when communicating.

## Recommendations

Recent studies increasingly use these brain training games to investigate their impact on cognition and brain training results. The recommended exercises referenced above have proven positive effects on the noted cognitive functions and are recommended by our Wellness Speech Therapists. Helpful wellness, weight, and exercise programs are also offered daily.
