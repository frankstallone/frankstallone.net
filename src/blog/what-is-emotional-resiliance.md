## What is emotional resiliance and why it is important to you

Like many of us, I was a slave to my emotions, set in my ways, and a poor candidate for change. When I became depressed over my stress, anxieties, and life's exhausting disappointments, I knew I needed control. I wanted to be cool. So, I read books, studied, and I practiced. With determination and persistence, I gained emotional resilience.

**What is Emotional Resilience?** Emotional resilience is an ability to respond and adapt to sources of adversity, traumatic experiences, rejection, threats, and stress. An emotionally resilient mind can maintain a relatively positive sense of well-being in the face of stressful experiences.

Developing a positive mindset and using positive self-talk empowers productive thinking. Stoics today use critical thinking and live by codes to handle conditions outside of their control. Any one of us can learn to develop and strengthen our emotional resilience. Many books are available on emotional intelligence, resilience, and mind-empowering subjects.

The following ideas and mindsets have helped me over time to achieve a more controlled life:

- **Mindset 1: Develop Positive Attitudes.** They improve faith in oneself. We all can empower ourselves to be more positive, successful, and achieve our goals.
- **Mindset 2: Emotional Adaptability and Recovery.** Understand and learn to feel what you choose to feel, rather than what you have arbitrarily learned to feel.
- **Maintain feelings of emotional stability.** Determination, self-encouragement, and positive self-thinking are all important accelerants to empower positive changes. When we change our thoughts in this manner, our lives will change for the better.
- **Meditation and Mindfulness.** Mindfulness is an excellent way to become aware of emotions that can generate negative thinking. Negative thinking is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Mindfulness will help us to spot and change any negative thinking toward more productive affirmations. You will eventually become empowered and in control. A King or a Queen of Cool.

Emotional resilience is a rewarding, life-changing ability that is well worth the effort. Life will become much easier, and you'll wish you had done it sooner.
