_From "The Wizard of Oz" Movie (1939) Staring Judy Garland_

At about 1:36:20, Wizard of Oz movie time, this scene begins right after Dorothy had visited the Wizard. However, she is still troubled because the Wizard never told her how she could return to Kansas.

Glenda, (The good witch) appears in this scene and says: "You’ve always had the power to go back to Kansas."
Scarecrow: "Why didn’t you tell here before?"
Glenda: "Because she wouldn’t have believed me. She had to learn it for herself."

For me, this is the theme, or the message of the movie. We all have capabilities beyond what we think we have. We don’t need a wizard. We just need ourselves.

So, how can we improve our capabilities? The mind responds to cognitive exercises such as taking on new challenges. Start a new hobby. Learn new skills such as the arts. Try painting. You don’t need to be good. Just paint something you enjoy. Listen to music. Learn to play a musical instrument. Learn a language. Try new word exercises such as Scrabble, crossword puzzles, or try writing about something that inspires you. Engage in deeper conversations with others. Be determined to make life more fun for yourself and the people you engage with.

Like the scarecrow, the tin man, and the lion, the people you help, or meet with – wind up giving you something more along the way. These exercises and the friends we converse with, will stimulate your mind and help improve your abilities. Attitude is everything. With open mindedness and positive thinking, solutions will be drawn to you.

I wish you the best of luck with your efforts and have a great day.
