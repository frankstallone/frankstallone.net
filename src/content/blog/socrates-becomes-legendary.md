What follows are the writings of Plato about why Socrates used
his dialectic questioning in the marketplace of Athens, and how it
got him into big trouble. Socrates received answers and advice
from his inner self, and from the Oracle at Delphi, a religious
shrine, and home of Pythia, a priestess who delivered prophesies
from the Greek god Apollo. <u>
She had famously proclaimed that
Socrates was the smartest man in Athens.
</u>

Socrates was incredulous. He tried to prove that she was wrong,
answering that “he knew nothing worth knowing”. He didn’t know
the answers to the big questions of life, about the gods, politics,
relationships of life, etcetera. However, the intellectuals,
professors, politicians, acted as if they knew. So, he used his
dialectics in the marketplace, to find answers, and he famously
revealed that the intellectual elite of Athens didn’t really know
those answers either. So, <u>
Socrates was the smarter because he
<em>knew</em> he didn’t know the answers
</u>. Most of them became so
angered by Socrates’ revealing their ignorance, that they got
together and brought him to trial on made up charges against him.
At his trial, no substantiated evidence was brought against him.

All accusations were untrue. Socrates was smart and defended
himself well. At the end of his trial, before any sentencing,
Socrates was told that if he stopped his dialogical investigations,
and renounced his beliefs, he could go free. He refused, saying
that searching for truths was his lifetime goal, and explained to his
accusers that <u>the unexamined life is not worth living</u>. He knew that
what he was saying was helpful advice. He told them that he was
pointing out misunderstandings and ignorance so they could work
them out. Socrates told the jurors that he should be praised by
his fellow citizens for showing them what they do not know, and
thereby giving them an incentive to improve themselves.

However, when it came to the vote on his innocence or guilt,
much of the jury voted with their emotion of anger and fears,
rather than with their reason. By only about 30 votes, the jury of
500 Athenians sentenced him to death by Hemlock poisoning.
Socrates submitted to his sentence willingly saying I’ve always
been a good citizen, and I have always obeyed the laws.
Even when his rich friend Crito told Socrates that he could help
him escape to another country, Socrates once again refused.
That would be morally wrong. I spent my life teaching people how
to be morally correct, and I cannot refute or desert my life’s work
now.

Socrates died rather than violate the law about his verdict. Nor
would he give up what he stood for to appease his oppressors to
save his own life. He was historically followed by Jesus, Mahatma
Gandhi, Abe Lincoln, Marten Luther King and others.

Socrates is universally known for his teaching, his morality, his
virtue, his humanity, his dialectic still used today, and as a teacher
of finding wisdom, and truths. Incredibly, 2,400 years later, many
of us still haven’t learned how to find wisdom, and truths.

remarkable man. Please see me or email me with your questions
